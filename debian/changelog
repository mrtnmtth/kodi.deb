kodi (15.2~rc1+dfsg1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make Breaks/Replaces relation to xbmc packages versioned.

  * Split architecture-indepedent data to kodi-data.
    Only the kodi and kodi-standalone binaries are kept in kodi package which is

  [ Balint Reczey ]
  * Really fix s390x build
  * Call ./configure through dh_auto_configure
  * Convert to package to use multiarch library dirs
  * Stop shipping kodi-dbg and disable debugging during build.
    This is a preparation for the automatically generated debug packages
    and switching to FFmpeg resulted less reported crashes to BTS.
    Kodi-dbg packages used quite a big space on mirrors and weren't used
    frequently.
  * Make kodi-addons-dev Replaces/Breaks: kodi-bin (<= 15.1+dfsg1-3)
    This is needed to manage moving .cmake files to to kodi-addons-dev.
  * Migrate from kodi-dbg to ddebs properly.
    Thanks to Mattia Rizzolo
  * Make kodi-addons-dev Architecture: any
  * Simplify debian/rules using exporting DH_OPTIONS
  * New upstream release candidate 15.2 RC1
    See http://kodi.tv/kodi-15-2-isengard-release-candidate-2/
  * Refresh patches

  [ Tobias Grimm ]
  * Fixed file name of patches/09-use-correct-ftgl.h
  * Install *.cmake files in kodi-addons-dev

  [ Mattia Rizzolo ]
  * debian/rules: correct use of `echo`
