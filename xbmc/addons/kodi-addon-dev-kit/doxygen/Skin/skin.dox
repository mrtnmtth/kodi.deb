@brief \doc_header{ Skin Add-On Development }

Kodi includes a GUI library that allows you to skin/change everything you see.
The images, sizes and positions of controls, colours, fonts, text, through to
altering navigation and even adding new functionality.

The skin system is quite complex. This portion of the manual is dedicated to
providing in depth information on how it all works. It contains tips to make the
experience a little more pleasant.

If you are just getting started with skinning Kodi, then it is suggested that the
best way to learn is by modifying one of the many existing skins that are
available. The default skin, Estuary, includes almost all the various tricks
and features that make the Kodi skinning engine so powerful, so is an ideal place
to start. You may wish to start by having a look through the tutorial section on
skinning Kodi as well as the "Skinning Kodi" article, and try modifying a window
or two by adding a button, or altering the textures or layout.
