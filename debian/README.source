The XBMC/Kodi project embeds many external projects under lib/ using a wide
range of licenses.
Some source files embedded with external libraries have ambiguous license
texts. While writing debian/copyright in those cases I assumed that the
original projects did not violate the licenses of those files by embedding them
and assumed the external librarys' license being in effect.
